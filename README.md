<strong>Fun facts!</strong> I used to make [award-winning comics for teenage girls](http://www.rachelthegreat.com/). Later, in my second careerâ€”in tech, I wrote a [book on UI animation](https://abookapart.com/products/animation-at-work). One day I want to make a graphic novel about front end development. Used to be kinda a lot in web animation land.
